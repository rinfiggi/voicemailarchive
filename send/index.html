            <h1>terms and conditions of the voicemail archive</h1>
            <p>welcome to the voicemail archive! before sending a message, please read the following terms and conditions carefully. by using our service, you agree to these terms.</p>

            <h2>1. service description</h2>
            <p>the voicemail archive is a creative project. you can call the published phone number and leave a voice message. that message may be published on voicemailarchive.com and may also be used in promotional or artistic formats (such as podcasts, exhibitions, social media, or other media we develop).</p>

            <h2>2. consent to publication</h2>
            <p>by leaving a voicemail, you agree to its recording, storage, and potential publication. messages may be edited for clarity, duration, or to remove sensitive content — but the core message will not be distorted.</p>

            <h2>3. processing of personal data</h2>
            <p>we do not store or publish your phone number. only the content of your voicemail is kept. once a message is published, it cannot be removed automatically. however, you may send a removal request to admin@voicemailarchive.com. we will consider all motivated requests, but we cannot guarantee removal, and it may take time due to the manual nature of our process.</p>

            <h2>4. prohibited content</h2>
            <p>do not send messages that contain hate speech, violence, threats, personal data (e.g. phone numbers, addresses, bank details), or anything defamatory. we reserve the right to discard such messages.</p>

            <h2>5. usage license</h2>
            <p>by submitting your message, you give us a free, non-exclusive, and permanent license to use it for this project — including on the website, in social media, artistic contexts, promotional materials, and future public communications.</p>

            <h2>6. liability</h2>
            <p>you are fully responsible for the content of the message you submit. we disclaim any liability for damages or claims that may arise from messages submitted by users.</p>

            <h2>7. changes to the terms</h2>
            <p>we may revise these terms at any time. continued use of the service means you accept the changes. the latest version will always be available on our website.</p>

            <h2>8. contact</h2>
            <p>need help or clarification? send an email at admin@voicemailarchive.com.</p>
